Description: Major mode for editing git commit messages
 This mode helps with editing git commit messages both by
 providing commands to do common tasks, and by highlighting the
 basic structure of and errors in git commit messages. Examples
 of available commands:
 .
 git-commit-commit   - Finish editing and commit
 git-commit-signoff  - Insert a Signed-off-by header
 git-commit-ack      - Insert an Acked-by header
 git-commit-review   - Insert a Reviewed-by header
 git-commit-cc       - Insert a Cc header
 git-commit-reported - Insert a Reported-by header
 .
 It also allows the use of things like ‘M-q’, You might want to integrate
 ‘flyspell-mode’ into the ‘git-commit-mode’.
 .
 Note: 2013-06-03 the code hasn't been touched since 2010.
